The objective of this first release was to have a very simple but playable game.  
To do so, only the core gameplay elements have been implemented, as simply as possible.

## Notes

* The player is represented as an arrow or a spaceship to avoid complexities related to sprite designs and animations
* The player and the enemies are only moving orthogonally (and diagonally for the player) to simplify the enemy AI 
* There is no color as there is no need for it for the moment

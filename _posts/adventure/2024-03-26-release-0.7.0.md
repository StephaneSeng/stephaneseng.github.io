This release improves the behavior of the virtual D-pad, by allowing changing directions just by dragging over it
(instead of having to tap and hold each button separately).  
This release also includes some graphical changes to give more identity to this game (just by using a color palette
and by displaying a grid).

## Notes

* The color palette used is [CC-29](https://lospec.com/palette-list/cc-29)
* This release took some time as I have hesitated between keeping that art style vs using a third-party
  tileset. In the end, I have chosen to keep this art style to ensure more creative freedom for the next releases.
